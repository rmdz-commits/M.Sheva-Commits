## 🧐 About This Repository

Welcome to my personal code archive! 

This repository serves as a centralized hub for my learning journey. It demonstrates my commitment to mastering the fundamentals of **Computer Science** and **Full Stack Development**. 

My goal is to write clean, efficient, and scalable code while understanding the underlying logic of how software and databases interact.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

Since I am exploring multiple technologies, this repository is categorized into the following core areas:

### 💻 Core Programming & Logic
* **Java & C++:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures & Algorithms, Memory Management, and Syntax proficiency.

### 🌐 Web Development (Frontend)
* **HTML & CSS:** Building responsive layouts, semantic structure, and styling.
* **JavaScript:** DOM manipulation, ES6+ features, and dynamic content handling.

### 🗄️ Data Management
* **SQL:** Relational database design, writing complex queries, joins, and data normalization.

### 🛠️ Version Control
* **Git:** Branching strategies, commit conventions, and collaborative workflows.

## 📂 Repository Structure

To keep the root directory clean, all source codes and exercises are organized within a dedicated folder.

> **⚠️ Note:** Please navigate to the **`[M.Sheva-Commits]`** directory to explore the actual code files, projects, and daily exercises.

Inside that folder, you will find sub-directories organized by technology or specific projects (e.g., `/Java`, `/C++`, `/SQL`).

## 📫 Contact

I am always open to discussing technology, code reviews, or collaboration opportunities.
